### CSCI*490 - Software Engineering II - Fall 2018 - Coastal Carolina University

Implementation of a basic blogging website in Java/JAX-RS. 

This project was a simulation of a real-life software development environment. Our group (myself and two others) collaborated to create a basic blogging website over the course of the semester. As part of the course, we each worked on our own fork of the project and pushed changes back to the main repository (this one).
